# Polynomial_Regression-and-Regularization

1. Derive the gradient expression for logistic regression with regularization. (Upload the photo)

2. Perform  polynomial regression of degree 3 on the given train dataset. Predict the mean square error for the test data set with the obtained model (use constant learning rate) also print the final weights.

   a)Without regularization
   b)With regularization
